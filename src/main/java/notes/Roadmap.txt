STARTING IDEA: Make a timer

IDEAS:
- Implement methods to move/scale group of elements as one (e.g. a numpad)
- Implement input-error finder for file writer, which determines what part
  of the inputs caused an IO exception, then tells user

IMPLEMENTATIONS TO DO:
TODO: add lap, log functionality to timer
TODO: implement file writer functionality
TODO: implement scroll bar for file content to file writer
TODO: (for file content @ file writer) implement automatic line break
      when edge is reached (or alternatively a horizontal scroll bar,
      additionally a button to switch auto-line-break on/off?)
TODO? account for OS differences in file writer functionality (specifically
      file pathing in windows)

FIXES/REWORKS TO DO:
TODO: remove parameter for window internal from listener (all methods
      in internal classes are static, so there's no need for an
      instance of the internal)
TODO? remove FileWriterController(), since file writer window has no
      actions that need time control (?)
TODO: fix rng status label not updating when generating number
