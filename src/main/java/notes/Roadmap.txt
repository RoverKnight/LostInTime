STARTING IDEA: Make a timer

IDEAS:
- Merge Internal and Controller by extending Internals from Thread, then using run() for
  any "live action" (e.g. timer, clock) and for everything else implement static methods

IMPLEMENTATIONS TO DO:
TODO: implement templates (for copy-paste & reference)
TODO: add more functionality
TODO: add lap, log functionality to timer
  TODO-note:
FIXES TO DO:
TODO: stop multiple shutdownConfirm windows form being able to exist simultaneously

TASKS DONE (TODAY):
- 24/08 - Fixed stop & resume buttons not switching: forgot to fetch the return value
          from TimerInternal.resumeTimer(), so it wasn't given back to TimerView(), so
          it's true current status wasn't known to TimerView()
- 24/08 - Fixed start & reset buttons not switching: a condition for checking if timer
          is running or has run before was faulty, used isPaused boolean from Controller
          class even though it is never changed anywhere in the code
- 24/08 - Refactored TimerView.switch[...]Buttons() methods to .autoSwitch[...]Buttons
          respectively
