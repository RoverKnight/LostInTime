STARTING IDEA: Make a timer

IDEAS:
- Implement methods to move/scale group of elements as one (e.g. a numpad)
- Implement input-error finder for file writer, which determines what part
  of the inputs caused an IO exception, then tells user
- Tic Tac Toe
- Implement Conways Game of Life w/ graphics

IMPLEMENTATIONS TO DO:
TODO: add lap, log functionality to timer
TODO: implement scroll bar for file content to file writer
TODO: (for file content @ file writer) implement automatic line break
      when edge is reached (or alternatively a horizontal scroll bar,
      additionally a button to switch auto-line-break on/off?)
TODO? account for OS differences in file writer functionality (specifically
      file pathing in windows)

FIXES/REWORKS TO DO:
TODO: remove parameter for window internal from listener (all methods
      in internal classes are static, so there's no need for an
      instance of the internal)
TODO: fix rng status label not updating when generating number
TODO: fix convertWithLineBreaks() not adding line breaks when a line
      break has been placed in the previous line
